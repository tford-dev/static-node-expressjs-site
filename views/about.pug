          p My name is Terrance Ford, I'm 24 years old and residing in Glen Allen, Virginia. I have experience with Python and Javascript with a focus on web developement and E-commerce. I first discovered that I had an interest in web developement when I was creating Shopify Stores in 2018 during my free time and since then I have decided to make web developement the center of my attention.
