# static-node-expressjs-site
I am responsible for the JavaScript of this project, the HTML/CSS for this project is a template I used for implementing functionality. 
I edited the dark-styles.css file in the css folder nested in the public directory to invert colors from styles.css.
The dark-mode/light mode button is located in the side bar beneath the "learn more" anchor tag.
This project can also run locally on a server by typing "npm start" in the terminal.
There is a route in app.js for loading the not-found.pug template when a route that doesn't exist is called.
